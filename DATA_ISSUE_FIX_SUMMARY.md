# 🔧 Data Issue Fix Summary - Identical Sales Values

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

### **Issue**: All Product Categories Showed Identical Sales Values
- **Books**: 43,167 total sales, 117.94 average sales
- **Clothing**: 43,167 total sales, 117.94 average sales  
- **Electronics**: 43,167 total sales, 117.94 average sales
- **Home & Garden**: 43,167 total sales, 117.94 average sales

### **Root Cause**: Identical Data Generation
The raw data file (`data/raw/retail_sales_dataset.csv`) contained **identical sales patterns** for all product categories:

```
Date,Product Category,Total Amount,Product ID
2024-01-01,Electronics,100,ELE000
2024-01-01,Clothing,100,CLO001
2024-01-01,Books,100,BOO002
2024-01-01,Home & Garden,100,HOM003
2024-01-02,Electronics,104,ELE004

2024-01-02,Books,104,BOO006
2024-01-02,Home & Garden,104,HOM007
```

**Pattern**: All products had the same sales value (100, 104, 108, 112, 117, 121, 125) repeating every 7 days.
